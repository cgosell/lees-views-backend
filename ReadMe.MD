# LeesViews and LeesViewsBackend

The goal of the code written in both LeesViews and LeesViewsBackend is to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for managing and displaying photos for various trips and activities.

LeesViews is a front-end application that allows users to browse and upload for photos. It provides a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation to enhance the user experience.

LeesViewsBackend is the back-end component that handles the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of photo data. It ensures data integrity, implements business logic, and exposes APIs for communication with the front-end application.

Together, LeesViews and LeesViewsBackend aim to create a robust and scalable system for managing user reviews, enabling businesses to gather valuable feedback and users to make informed decisions.
